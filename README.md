# DUTY ROSTER
As the name suggests Duty Roster is made to set the duties of people who works in the hospital.
In hospitals the people have shifts i.e. either evening shift, morning shift, night shift and many more different.
It is just like execl sheet but the main thing is the user who is making the duty list just have to enter name and select from the list of different duties.
The user has to select the month for which he/she has to make the duty list. Correspondingly the tables will be created and the user can add rows according to his needs.
The local storage supports helps the user to create the list anytime he/she finds free time.
This Project is made by using HTML,CSS,JavaScript.Press Ctrl+P to print the duty list.
